    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    

    <p>On this page you will find answers to many frequently asked questions. Please note that our official course policies are outlined on the policies page. If you cannot find the answer to your question, you are encouraged to reach out to your lab TA or post on Ed.</p>
<h3>Enrollment</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Will I be allowed to take the course remotely?</strong></p>
<p>The summer 2022 iteration offers a limited number of remote sections for students with extenuating circumstances. Extenuating circumstances include - but are not limited to - medical reasons, employment, or housing. Prior to the term, a form will be sent out to all students. The decisions will be released prior to the drop deadline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is self-service lab?</strong></p>
<p>Self-service lab allows students with prior university-level coding and statistics backgrounds to be exempt from going to lab. These students will not be assigned a lab section and are expected to finish the lab assignments independently. Along with the remote accommodations form a self-service lab application will be sent out. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Logistics</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course?</strong></p>
<p>Grades will be displayed on Gradescope for the written and autograded portions for all assignments (homeworks, labs, projects, and exams). For homeworks and projects, your total grade is the sum of the autograded portion and the written portion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I passed all the tests when doing my homework/project, but still got points off on the autograded portion of the assignment. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p>The homeworks and projects have hidden tests that are not visible to students while they do the assignment. In order to pass these hidden tests, you must test your code yourself and make sure your answer is correct. Our tests are not always comprehensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have a 0 on Gradescope for a lab that I attended and got checked off. Why is this?</strong></p>
<p>You likely did not submit the lab. If it is before the regrade deadline, submit the lab, and let your lab TA know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on Gradescope for the project while I do not. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p>This is normal. Only one partner should have a grade on Gradescope, but the score will be applied to both partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I noticed a mistake in the grading of the written portion of my homework. How can I get this fixed?</strong></p>
<p>To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request via Gradescope before the regrade deadline. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has closed. All regrade deadline dates are posted on the same Ed post that releases the assignment grades and solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I have some other grading questions. Who should I contact?</strong></p>
<p>Please contact your lab TA.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Course Advice</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the best way to get help in this course?</strong></p>
<p>Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Ed. Course staff will be monitoring Ed frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly. Additionally, we offer additional <a href="materials.md">resources</a> which you might find useful to go over.</p>
