    "The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are integers, so the bins chosen by `hist` only have entries at the edges. In such a situation, it is a better idea to select bins so that they are centered on the integers. This is often true of histograms of data that are *discrete*, that is, variables whose successive values are separated by the same fixed amount. The real advantage of this method of bin selection will become more clear when we start imagining smooth curves drawn over histograms."
