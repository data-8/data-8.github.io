      <h2>Course Description</h2>

<div class="description">

This introductory course in data science is built on three interrelated
perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world
relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one
analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon?  How does one collect
data to answer questions that one is interested in?  Inferential thinking
refers to an ability to connect data to underlying phenomena and to the ability
to think critically about the conclusions that are drawn from data analysis.
Computational thinking refers to the ability to conceive of the abstractions
and processes that allow inferential procedures to be embodied in computer
programs, and to ensure that such programs are scalable, robust and
understandable.  In addition to teaching basic skills in computer programming
and statistical inference, the course will also involve the hands-on analysis
of a variety of real-world datasets, including economic data, document
collections, geographical data and social networks, and it will delve into
social and legal issues surrounding data analysis, including issues of privacy
and data ownership.
