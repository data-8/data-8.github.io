    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    

    <p><strong>Q: I am not able to attend the live lectures, labs, and/or discussions. Can I still take the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: We encourage students to attend these live sessions. We realize that this is not always possible or convenient, so we provide alternatives where possible. Attendance at discussion sections is mandatory; there is no asynchronous option for discussion sections. However we will provide many options for time slots, to maximize the chances you can find one that will work for you. Lectures will be will be recorded; you can attend lecture live or watch the recordings asynchronously if you prefer. We recommend attending labs synchronously, but we do offer the option to complete the labs ahead of time remotely as detailed in the <a href="http://data8.org/sp21/policies.html">policies</a> section. If you cannot attend a live lab session but require some help with the lab, consider attending one of the many office hours. The textbook is also a great resource, though it is not a perfect substitute for discussions, labs, live lectures, and office hours.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the best way to get help in this course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Piazza. Course staff will be monitoring piazza frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Grades will be displayed on two websites. OkPy will display your lab grades, as well as the grades for the autograded portions for homeworks and projects. Gradescope will display your grades for the written/visual portions for homeworks and projects, as well as your exam grades. For homeworks and projects, your total grade is the sum of the autograded portion and the written portion.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I passed all the tests when doing my homework/project, but still got points off on the autograded portion of the assignment. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: The homeworks and projects have hidden tests that are not visible to students while they do the assignment. In order to pass these hidden tests, you must test your code yourself and make sure your answer is correct. Our tests are not always comprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have a 0 on OkPy for a lab that I attended and got checked off. Why is this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: You likely did not submit the lab. If it is before the regrade deadline, go on OkPy, submit the lab, and let your Discussion GSI know.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on Gradescope for the project while I do not. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: This is normal. Only one partner should have a grade on Gradescope, but the score will be applied to both partners.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I noticed a mistake in the grading of the Gradescope portion of my homework. How can I get this fixed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request via Gradescope before the regrade deadline. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has closed. All regrade deadline dates are posted on the same Piazza post that releases the assignment grades and solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have some other grading questions. Who should I contact?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Please contact your Discussion GSI.</p>
