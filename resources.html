      <h2 id="piazza">Piazza</h2>

<p><a href="http://piazza.com/">Piazza</a> is a platform where we (instructors and students) can post announcements, have discussions, and ask questions.  To add the course on Piazza, go to "Students Get Started" on piazza.com, find UC Berkeley, and find Statistics 94.  Create a student account with your Berkeley email.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask questions by email, but staff will check Piazza more frequently, and often other students will answer more quickly than we can.  Plus, you'll help out other students who have the same question.</p>


<h2 id="bcourses">bCourses</h2>

<p><a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu">bCourses</a> is where we will post information that can't go on the public Internet.  Currently it only contains your grades.  By enrolling in the class, you should be automatically signed up for the bCourses page.</p>


<h2 id="tips-on-using-jupyter-notebooks">Tips on using Jupyter notebooks</h2>

<p>Labs and course projects will be done in Jupyter notebooks (also called iPython notebooks).  A notebook is a mix of text and computer code that you can edit.  (Editing is disabled for parts of some notebooks, but this is just to make sure you don't accidentally mess them up.)</p>

<p>You can create and edit notebooks yourself by installing software on any computer.  But it's easier (and in the case of labs and projects, necessary) to edit notebooks using <a href="https://ds8.berkeley.edu">the course webpage</a>.</p>


<h3 id="the-first-lab">The first lab</h3>

<p>For example, here are the steps to get started on the first lab:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a web browser on any computer.  <strong>Currently, the only supported web browser is Chrome.</strong>  (There's a problem with using the site in Safari, and possibly other browsers.  We're working on it.)</li>
  <li>Go to https://ds8.berkeley.edu .</li>
  <li>You should be prompted to log in to your Cal Google account.  (For example, a.student@berkeley.edu .)</li>
  <li>Click the green “My Server” button.</li>
  <li>Navigate to labs/lab01 and click “Lab 1 - Python and Jupyter.ipynb”.  (Future labs will be under labs/labXY, and projects will be under projects/projectXY.)</li>
  <li>The lab notebook has instructions for completing it.  Lab 1 has more detailed tips for editing notebooks.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="if-something-goes-wrong">If something goes wrong</h3>

<p>A notebook is really just a file (named, for example, "Lab 1 — Python &amp; Jupyter.ipynb") that lives in a folder that's been set up for you on the course servers.  You are accessing and modifying notebook files when you open them on ds8.berkeley.edu.</p>

<p>Initially, everyone has the same copy of the assignment notebooks, but as you fill it in with your code and text, your copy diverges from the original.  It's possible, with a little ingenuity, to mess up your copy.  If this happens, you can ask course staff to give you a new copy of the original assignment notebook, without any of your changes.  (Unfortunately, you might lose whatever progress you've made on the assignment, unless it can be recovered.)</p>
