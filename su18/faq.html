    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    

    <p><strong>Q: I am not able to attend some days of lecture. Can I still take the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: You are still able to take this course, though be aware lectures will not be webcast. The textbook is a great resource, but not a perfect subsitute for lecture. You may complete the labs ahead of time remotely as detailed in the <a href="http://data8.org/su18/policies.html">policies</a> section. Do be sure, however, that you are able to make the midterm and the final. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the best way to get help in this course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Piazza. Course staff will be monitoring piazza frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly. 
<br><br>
<strong>Q: Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Grades will be displayed on three websites. OkPy will display your lab grades, as well as the grades for the autograded portions for homeworks and projects. Gradescope will display your grades for the written/visual portions for homeworks and projects, as well as your exam grades. Bcourses will display your total grades for each assignment. For homeworks and projects, your total grade is the sum of the autograded portion and the written portion.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: I passed all the tests when doing my homework/project, but still got points off on the autograded portion of the assignment. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The homeworks and projects have hidden tests that are not visible to students while they do the assignment. In order to pass these hidden tests, you must test your code yourself and make sure your answer is correct. Our tests are not always comprehensive.
<br><br>
<strong>Q: I have have a 0 on OkPy for a lab that I attended and got checked off. Why is this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You likely did not submit the lab. Go on OkPy, submit the lab, and let your Lab TA know. If you did submit the lab but still have a 0, please contact your Lab TA. 
<br><br>
<strong>Q: I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on Gradescope for the project while I do not. Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is normal. Only one partner should have a grade on Gradescope, but the score will be applied to both partners. 
<br><br>
<strong>Q: I noticed a mistake in the grading of the gradescope portion of my homework. How can I get this fixed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request via Gradescope within the 4 days of the release date of the grades. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has cloesd. 
<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Q: I have some other grading question. Who should I contact?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Please contact your Lab GSI.
