    "Programming can dramatically improve our ability to collect and analyze information about the world, which in turn can lead to discoveries through the kind of careful reasoning demonstrated in the previous section. In data science, the purpose of writing a program is to instruct a computer to carry out the steps of an analysis. Computers cannot study the world on their own. People must describe precisely what steps the computer should take in order to collect and analyze data, and those steps are expressed through programs.\n",

Programs are made up of *expressions*, which describe to the computer how to combine pieces of data. For example, a multiplication expression consists of a `*` symbol between two numerical expressions. Expressions, such as `3 * 4`, are *evaluated* by the computer. The value (the result of *evaluation*) of the last expression in each cell, `12` in this case, is displayed below the cell."
