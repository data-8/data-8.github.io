    "So far, we have talked about *prediction*, where the purpose of learning is to be able to predict the class of new instances.  I'm now going to switch to *model building*, where the goal is to learn a model of how the class depends upon the attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One place where model building is useful is for science: e.g., which genes influence whether you become diabetic?  This is interesting and useful in its right (apart from any applications to predicting whether a particular individual will become diabetic), because it can potentially help us understand the workings of our body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another place where model building is useful is for control: e.g., what should I change about my advertisement to get more people to click on it?  How should I change the profile picture I use on an online dating site, to get more people to \"swipe right\"?  Which attributes make the biggest difference to whether people click/swipe?  Our goal is to determine which attributes to change, to have the biggest possible effect on something we care about.\n",

    "### Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Background: attributes are also called *features*, in the machine learning literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find a subset of features that are most relevant to the output.  The way we'll formalize is this is to identify a subset of features that, when we train a classifier using just those features, gives the highest possible accuracy at prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, if we get 90% accuracy using the features and 88% accuracy using just three of the features (for example), then it stands to reason that those three features are probably the most relevant, and they capture most of the information that affects or determines the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this insight, our problem becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Find the subset of $\\ell$ features that gives the best possible accuracy (when we use only those $\\ell$ features for prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a feature selection problem.  There are many possible approaches to feature selection.  One simple one is to try all possible ways of choosing $\\ell$ of the features, and evaluate the accuracy of each.  However, this can be very slow, because there are so many ways to choose a subset of $\\ell$ features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we'll consider a more efficient procedure that often works reasonably well in practice.  It is known as greedy feature selection.  Here's how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose there are $d$ features.  Try each on its own, to see how much accuracy we can get using a classifier trained with just that one feature.  Keep the best feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now we have one feature.  Try remaining $d-1$ features, to see which is the best one to add to it (i.e., we are now training a classifier with just 2 features: the best feature picked in step 1, plus one more).  Keep the one that best improves accuracy.  Now we have 2 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat.  At each stage, we try all possibilities for how to add one more feature to the feature subset we've already picked, and we keep the one that best improves accuracy.\n",

We've tried multiple different approaches, and taken the best; if we then evaluate it on the same data set we used to select which is best, we will get a biased numbers -- an overestimate of the true accuracy.\n",

He picks the fastest student and has them represent us in their next track meet.  How do you think that student's performance in the next track meet will be, compared to their tryout?  Faster than in tryouts?  Slower than in tryouts?  Exactly the same?\n",

    "Well, if running was all skill and no luck, then the student's time would be exactly the same.  But there's also an element of randomness: some people do better, or worse, on any given day.  If it was all randomness, the coach would be picking the runner who got the luckiest in try-outs, not the runner who is the fastest, and at the meet that runner would almost certainly be slower than in tryouts -- their speed in the tryout is biased, not an accurate estimate of their future performance.  The same will tend to be true if performance is a mixture of skill and luck.\n",

    "\n",
    "The way to get an unbiased estimate of performance is the same as last lecture: get some more data; or set some aside in the beginning so we have more when we need it.  In this case, I set aside two extra chunks of data, a *validation* data set and a *test* data set.  I used the validation set to select a few best features.  Now we're going to measure the performance of this on the test set, just to see what happens."

    "The scientists also gathered some more data that I left out, for simplicity: for each location, they also gathered what kind of soil it has, out of 40 different types.  The original data set had a column for soil type, with numbers from 1-40 indicating which of the 40 types of soil was present.  Suppose I wanted to include this among the other characteristics.  What would go wrong, and how could I fix it up?\n",

There are some characteristics I can't change (such as how handsome I am), and some I can (such as whether I smile or not).  How would I adjust the feature selection algorithm above to account for this?"
