For example, if we are dealing two cards at random without replacement from a standard deck, then knowing that the first card dealt is the ace of spades would tell us that it is impossible for the second card to be the ace of spades. Such events are called *dependent*.\n",

    "To understand our answer, it is important to recall the chance model: our calculation is valid for **a person picked at random from the population**. Among all the people in the population, the people who test positive split into two groups: those who have the disease and test positive, and those who don't have the disease and test positive. The latter group is called the group of *false positives*. The proportion of true positives is twice as high as that of the false positives – $0.01 \\times 0.99$ compared to $0.99 \\times 0.005$ – and hence the chance of a true positive given a positive test result is $2/3$. The chance is affected both by the accuracy of the test and also by the probability that the sampled person has the disease.\n",

    "This cannot be decided based on relative frequencies. The probability that a particular individual has the disease has to be based on a subjective opinion, and is therefore called a *subjective probability*.

The chance that a candidate wins the next election, the chance that a big earthquake will hit the Bay Area in the next decade, the chance that a particular country wins the next soccer World Cup: none of these are based on relative frequencies or long run frequencies. Each one contains a subjective element. \n",

Be aware also that different people can have different subjective probabilities of the same event.
